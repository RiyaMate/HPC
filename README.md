Introduction
Background
Plant diseases have been a significant challenge throughout human history, with records of their impact spanning thousands of years. As agriculture advanced and societies grew increasingly dependent on crops for sustenance and trade, the effects of plant diseases became more profound. Today, with a rapidly expanding global population and rising environmental concerns, addressing plant diseases is more critical than ever. These diseases not only undermine food security by reducing crop yields and quality but also disrupt ecosystems, threaten biodiversity, and create ecological imbalances. Moreover, conventional methods of controlling plant diseases, such as the use of chemical pesticides, often harm the environment, underscoring the need for sustainable solutions. Consequently, understanding, preventing, and managing plant diseases are essential steps to ensure agricultural productivity and environmental stability in the face of these challenges.
Motivation
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), plant diseases cause an annual reduction of 20-40% in global crop yields, resulting in billions of dollars in economic losses for farmers. These diseases also contribute to food shortages and price fluctuations, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations in developing nations. Their environmental impact is equally concerning, as they disrupt essential ecosystem services, degrade soil quality, and threaten biodiversity. This project aims to develop an advanced system for the accurate identification and monitoring of diseased plants, addressing these challenges by equipping farmers and researchers with timely information for targeted interventions. By leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and image processing, the project seeks to improve disease surveillance while reducing reliance on chemical inputs, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices, environmental conservation, and enhanced global food security.
Goal
The primary objective of this project is to develop an innovative plant disease detection system utilizing PyTorch and multiprocessing techniques. This system is designed to accurately identify and classify plant diseases from images by leveraging advanced deep learning models and parallel processing to achieve high-performance detection. By using PyTorch for model training and development, combined with multiprocessing for efficient data handling, the aim is to create a robust and scalable solution capable of detecting a wide array of plant diseases. The ultimate goal is to replace subjective, time-consuming manual inspections with a proactive, automated approach to disease management, thereby minimizing the environmental impact of traditional disease control methods.
